The commands are broken into folders based on the input size they are for.
Originally, the models were all developed to be 32x32 (32 pixels for the camera).
There is also a `shared.md` in this folder and that contains commands that can be used regardless of input size.

**Note**: This whole directory is a mess and commands are scattered throughout.
I have been trying to keep it semi-organized, but it could be much better.
You have been warned.
