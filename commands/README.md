The commands are broken into folders based on what project they are for.
Originally, all the commands were for the LLOWFS (32x32 camera).
There is also a `shared.md` in this folder and that contains commands that can be used regardless of the project.

**Note**: This whole directory is a mess and commands are scattered throughout.
I have been trying to keep it semi-organized, but it could be much better.
You have been warned.
